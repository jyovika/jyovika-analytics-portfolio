# Jyovika Aswale: Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a curated collection of data analysis projects written in R and published through Quarto. Each project focuses on clear statistical reasoning, polished visualisation, and insights that connect data to real decision making.

I use this portfolio to demonstrate my approach to analysis:

  - Start with exploration, understand how the data behaves, choose suitable models, test assumptions, communicate uncertainty, and present results in a way that anyone can understand.

## 🔍 What You Will Find Here

#### Data Analysis and Modelling

  - Distribution fitting
  - Simulation and bootstrapping
  - Regression and sensitivity analysis
  - Hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation
  - Exploratory data analysis with tidy workflows

#### Visualisation and Communication
  - ggplot2 graphics designed for clarity
  - Diagnostic plots that show how models behave
  - Story driven blog posts published through Quarto
  - Layouts and themes created with custom CSS
  
#### Reproducible Workflows
  - Each project is built in Quarto
  - Code, data, and results stay together
  - The repository contains all supporting scripts and assets needed to rebuild the site

## 🎨 Custom Styling

This site uses a custom CSS theme created from scratch.

Key features include:

  - soft green palette for headings and accents
  - redesigned navigation and callouts
  - typography that supports long form analytics writing
  - consistent styling across plots, tables, and metadata
  - You can view and reuse the theme in styles.css.

## 🔧 How to Build Locally

If you want to render the full site:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install required packages
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "MASS", "boot", "broom", "here"))

# render the site
quarto::quarto_render()
```

## 🤝 Collaboration Notes

Some projects began as university group assignments.

I expanded and rewrote the analysis for public presentation.
