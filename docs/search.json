Repeated losses change outcomes. A quarter of a place here and half a place there becomes the difference between a podium and fourth, or between finishing in the points and missing out.\nBy comparison, grid position has a far stronger effect.

One second typically costs less than a tenth of a finishing place but the impact becomes powerful when repeated across races, seasons or drivers.\nGrid position remains the strongest determinant of outcome and race pace is the engine of everything. Pit crews are not out to perform miracles, they are fighting to avoid thousands of small cuts.\nIn Formula One, fractions are currency, and pit time is one of them."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe centre of Melbourne is full of movement and energy. Every day thousands of people pass through places like Southern Cross, Flinders Street, and QV Melbourne. At first glance it feels chaotic. Underneath that movement however is a pattern. I wanted to understand those patterns and tell a story about how these three locations behave.\nI approached this like a real analytics problem. Start with descriptive exploration. Fit distributions that reflect the character of each location. Estimate meaningful quantities for planning and design. Compare sites in a way that answers the practical questions that planners and marketers actually care about. By the end of the analysis, these three crossings no longer felt like random busy spots on a map. They felt like distinct personalities with their own rhythms and their own commercial and operational implications."
