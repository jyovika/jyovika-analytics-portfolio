::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="people" title="Collaboration & Original Assignment"}
This analysis began as a group assignment for our Statistical Thinking unit, completed together with **Sia Chawla** and **Siddhi Jadhav**.  
The core data wrangling, modelling, and statistical code were developed collaboratively.

This blog post is my own adapted version for my analytics portfolio, I’ve rewritten the narrative, added explanations, and restructured the presentation for a broader readership, but the underlying work is **not solely my own**.
