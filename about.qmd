## About Me

I am currently completing a Master of Business Analytics at **Monash University**, building on my undergraduate studies in **Economics**.  
My academic journey has strengthened my skills in data analysis, interpretation, and communication, and I am particularly interested in how analytical tools can inform evidence-based decisions in health, policy, and business.

I am developing proficiency in **R, Python, Quarto, and GitHub**, with a focus on reproducible workflows and clear data communication. Through projects and coursework, I have enjoyed working on tasks that involve cleaning and transforming complex datasets, creating effective visualisations, and presenting insights in a way that is accessible to different audiences.

Outside of university, I prioritise health and balance- I train regularly and keep learning about nutrition. I also enjoy hands-on creative work, like building LEGO or cooking, and I unwind by rewatching a few of my favourite series.
