Slow stops therefore matter, but not in an explosive way. A delay of two or three seconds rarely destroys a race, but the effect compounds across a season.\nSmall losses are harmless alone. Repeated losses change outcomes. A quarter of a place here and half a place there becomes the difference between a podium and fourth, or between finishing in the points and missing out.\nBy comparison, grid position has a far stronger effect. Starting one place further back costs nearly half a finishing position. Pit time matters, but track position matters more."

In a tight field, even dents matter."

    "text": "Conclusion\nPit stops matter, but not always in the dramatic way commentary suggests. One second typically costs less than a tenth of a finishing place but the impact becomes powerful when repeated across races, seasons or drivers.\nGrid position remains the strongest determinant of outcome and race pace is the engine of everything. Pit crews are not out to perform miracles, they are fighting to avoid thousands of small cuts.\nIn Formula One, fractions are currency, and pit time is one of them."
